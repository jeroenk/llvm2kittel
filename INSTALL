Requirements:
-------------

  * A C++ compiler (both gcc and clang have been tested).
  * LLVM (versions 2.9 and 3.4 have been tested, but all versions from 2.9
          up to and including 4.0 should work).
  * GMP

Build instructions:
-------------------

  1. Run CMake for a build directory:
       $ mkdir /path/to/llvm2kittel-build
       $ cd /path/to/llvm2kittel-build
       $ cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/llvm-build /path/to/llvm2kittel

  2. Run 'make' from the build directory.
